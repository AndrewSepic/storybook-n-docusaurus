This repo contains two distributed packages:

- An [addon](https://storybook.js.org/docs/7.0/react/addons/introduction) that allows you to render and develop Docusaurus components: [`/addon`](./addon/)
- A [framework](https://storybook.js.org/docs/7.0/react/api/new-frameworks) that extends the [@storybook/react-webpack5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/react-webpack5) framework and does everything the addon does: [`/framework`](./framework/)
