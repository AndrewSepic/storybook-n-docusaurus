# storybook-addon-docusaurus

ðŸ¦– A Storybook addon to aid in developing with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Features

- Adds support for Docusaurus module aliases such as `@theme`, `@docusaurus`, `@generated`, and `@site`. [Theme alias](https://docusaurus.io/docs/advanced/client#theme-aliases) loading order is also respected across core theme, plugin-provided, and swizzled components.
- Enables core Docusaurus loaders for JS, SVG, and fonts and other assets. Will prefer [docusaurus-plugin-sass](https://github.com/rlamana/docusaurus-plugin-sass) over Storybook's SASS loader.
- Loads the [client modules](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugin-methods/lifecycle-apis#getClientModules) and [Webpack configs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugin-methods/lifecycle-apis#configureWebpack) from all plugins.
- Applies a global decorator that wraps all components in Docusaurus React contexts, allowing the rendering of all swizzled components.
